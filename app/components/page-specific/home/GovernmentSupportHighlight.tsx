          As part of Uganda's agricultural transformation agenda, our farm was
          selected to receive a government issued maize sheller, supporting
          value addition and efficient poultry feed formulation. We also
          actively participate in initiatives aimed at empowering rural farmers
          through technology and improved inputs.
